This repository contains a Python-based tool designed for automated scanning of web applications to detect SQL injection (SQLi) and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It includes a set of predefined payloads for SQL injection (sql_payload.txt) and XSS (xss_payloads.txt) to aid in comprehensive security testing.

Features:
  • SQL Injection Detection: Automated scanning using custom payloads.
  • Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection: Identification of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
  • Customizable Payloads: Easily extendable with additional payloads for specific testing needs.
